I'm happy to announce the release of Netty 4.1.0.Beta8. This will be the last beta release for 4.1 and we aim releasing 4.1.0.CR1 next week.

Because of this please test this release asap so we can fix any remaining issues in a timely manner.

For the details and all changes, please browse [our issue tracker](https://github.com/netty/netty/issues?q=milestone%3A4.1.0.Beta8).

As always, please let us know if you find any issues. We love feedback!
