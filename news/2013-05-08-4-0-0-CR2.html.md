title: 'Netty 4.0.0.RC2 released'

Its my pleasure announcing the second RC release of Netty 4.0.0. Unfortunatelly there is some api-breakage when upgrading from RC1. We had to do this to eliminate some issues / limitations which was found by users using RC1. So when upgrade please read the upgrade section.

Thanks again to everyone who helped us to fix issues and make the release even more stable.

You can grab the release from our [download page](http://netty.io/downloads.html) and from maven central. 

If you have any feedback please let us know, we love to receive it. 

## Upgrade
Please read this section before upgrade to CR2.

### ChannelHandler and sub-types
* ChannelHandler.beforeAdd(...) and beforeRemove(...) was removed because it made it very difficult to fullfill the Thread-Model and not block at all. 
* ChannelHandler.afterAdd(...) was renamed to handlerAdded(...) and afterRemove to handlerRemoved(...)
This may not affect any of your code if you not made use of those and just extended the Adapter classes.
 
### ChannelInboundHandler / ChannelOutboundHandler and sub-types
* Removed ChannelInboundHandler.freeInboundBuffer() and ChannelOutboundHandler.freeOutboundBuffer() as its not needed anymore
This may not affect any of your code as usually you use an Adapter class and not provide your own implementation of the method. In most cases only direct implementing classes of the the interfaces are affected.

### \*ToMessageDecoder, \*ToMessageEncoder, \*ToMessageCodec
* encode(...)  / decode(...) now takes a MessageBuf<Object> as parameter and use void as return type. So once you are done with encode/decode messages you will add them the the MessageBuf by call MessageBuf.add(...). This was done to eliminate the ugly handling / support of folded messages.
This will most likely affect you if you wrote a decoder / encode / codec that will output Objects.

### SslHandler
* SslHandler.handshake() was renamed to SslHandler.handshakeFuture() as it is more consistent. Also it now returns a Future<Channel> and not anymore a ChannelFuture.
* SslHandler.closeNotifyFutre() returns a Future<Channel> and not anymore a ChannelFuture.

### ByteBufHolder and sub-types
* ByteBufHolder.data() was renamed to content(). This also means other interfaces that extend it are effected. This includes HttpContent (and sub-types), DatagramPacket, SctpMessage, SpdyDataFrame, WebSocketFrame

### ChannelPipeline
* Remove ChannelPipeline.removeForward(...) and ChannePipline.replaceForward(...) as stuff is now forwarded on remove(...) / replace(...).

### ServerBootstrap / Bootstap
* ServerBootstrap.shutdown() and Bootstrap.shutdown() were @deprecated. Please use the EventLoopGroup.shutdownGracefully() method to shutdown the EventLoopGroup once not needed anymore

### EventLoopGroup
* EventLoopGroup.shutdown() was @deprecated and a new shutdownGracefully() method was added. Please use the new method to make sure the EventLoopGroup is shutdown gracefully.


## Changes in general
This release fixed 90 issues / tasks and so it's highly recommend to upgrade as soon as possible. We understand that the upgrade is not as easy as "drop-in" the new jar, but we thought all the api changes really worth the pain before go final. 

Beside fixed it also ships with a few new features which may worth some more details:

* [#762](https://github.com/netty/netty/issues/762) Added a WebSockeClientHandler which makes it super easy to write WebSocket clients with Netty. See the apidocs for more details.
* [#1207](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/1207) Add WebSocketFrameAggregator which can be used to aggregate partial frames
* [#1244](https://github.com/netty/netty/issues/1244) Allow to pass DefaultChannelTransferPromise to sendFile(..) operation to get notified on every partial transfer
