I'm happy to announce the release of Netty 4.1.0.CR4 after 1 month of work. We also bumped the version of the next release out of the 4.1 branch to 4.1.0.Final-SNAPSHOT which means we are very close so please test ASAP :)

The most important changes in this release are:

* DnsNameResolver: makes possible to define additional records in DNS query ([#4871](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/4871))
* DnsNameResolverContext infinite loop ([#4771](https://github.com/netty/netty/issues/4771))
* HTTP/2 stream removed from map before onStreamClosed called ([#4888](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/4888))
* Add support for directly decoding/encoding DNS PTR Records ([#4912](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/4912))
* EPOLL ET AutoRead ([#4919](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/4919))
* HTTP/2 DefaultHttp2Connection NPE ([#4933](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/4933))
* Netty 4.1.0.CR1: DNS resolver accepts invalid FQDN with label length > 63 octet ([#4935](https://github.com/netty/netty/issues/4935))
* Netty 4.1.0.CR1: DNS resolver do not treat non-ASCII characters correctly ([#4937](https://github.com/netty/netty/issues/4937))
* Fix potential infinite loop when resolving CNAME records ([#4946](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/4946))
* HTTP/2 DefaultHttp2ConnectionEncoder data frame size incorrect if error ([#4965](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/4965))


For the details and all changes, please browse [our issue tracker](https://github.com/netty/netty/issues?q=milestone%3A4.1.0.CR4+is%3Aclosed). Also most of the issues fixed for [netty-4.0.35.Final](https://github.com/netty/netty/issues?q=milestone%3A4.0.35.Final+is%3Aclosed) are fixes as well for CR4.

As always, please let us know if you find any issues. We love feedback!

# Important notes
As our http2 and dns codecs are still quite new we "mark" these as experimental which means we may break the api's of these in later releases.
