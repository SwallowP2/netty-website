Today we released Netty 4.0.10.Final. This is a long awaited bug-fix release (and some minor improvements), that closes in 26 issues / tasks . As expected from a bug-fix release it is API compatible to previous version out of the 4.0.x tree.


## Most important changes / fixes
* WebSocket08FrameDecoder may leak memory if channel is closed before the full frame was received ([#1874](https://github.com/netty/netty/issues/1874)) 
* Data corruption when duplicate/slice buffers and use on different EventLoops ([#1865](https://github.com/netty/netty/issues/1865)) 
* Channel writability change notifications sometimes fail to fire ([#1832](https://github.com/netty/netty/issues/1832)) 
* Using DatagramChannel.write(...) without bind the channel fails ([#1830](https://github.com/netty/netty/issues/1830)) 
* No easy way to bootstrap DatagramChannel which should not be bound ([#1829](https://github.com/netty/netty/issues/1829)) 
* CompositeByteBuf.removeComponent(lastIndex) throws IndexOutOfBoundException if components left ([#1821](https://github.com/netty/netty/issues/1821)) 
* HttpContentEncoder must pass through messages as it is when encoding is not needed / possible ([#1818](https://github.com/netty/netty/issues/1818))
