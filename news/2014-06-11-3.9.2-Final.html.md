Today we are happy to announce the release of Netty 3.9.2.Final. This is an important release if you use a previous version of the 3.9 branch because it fixes a possible DoS attack
when using the SslHandler. So please upgrade as soon as possible. For the security bug CVE-2014-3488 was assigned.

Beside the security fix this release also allows to use our own OpenSSLEngine which uses OpenSSL for maximal performance and low latency.

## Most important changes / fixes
* Possible DoS by CPU exhaustion when using malicious SSL packets ([#2562](https://github.com/netty/netty/issues/2562))
* Add OpenSslEngine ([#2464](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/2464))
* Provide universal API to create an SSLEngine ([#2499](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/2499))
* Minimize memory footprint of HashedWheelTimer and context-switching ([#2453](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/2453))
