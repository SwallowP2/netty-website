We are pleased to announce the release of Netty 4.0.8.Final. This is a bug-fix release but also includes performance improvements. As expected from a bug-fix release it is API compatible to previous version out of the 4.0.x tree.

In summary this release closes 39 issues.

This release would have been not possible without the feedback of our community. We welcome everyone to [become a part of it](http://netty.io/community.html), and help us to make Netty even better!

As always please let us know if you find any issues.

### More details on changes
To make use of the new JdkZlibDecoder and so be able to use compression on java 7+ without any extra dependency you will need to specify an extra System property. This was done to not change behavior and give the new feature more time to become major. To enable it please use -Dio.netty.noJdkZlibDecoder=false.
