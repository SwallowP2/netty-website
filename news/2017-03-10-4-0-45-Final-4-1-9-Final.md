I'm happy to announce the latest bug-fix releases for our 4.0.x and 4.1.x series.
These releases contains tons of changes (including bug-fixes, performance enhancements and features) so we encourage everyone to upgrade.

The most important changes for 4.0.45.Final and 4.1.9.Final are:

* UnorderedThreadPoolEventExecutor consumes 100% CPU when idle ([#6518](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/6518))
* Correct usages of internalNioBuffer ([#6486](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/6486))
* Expose ByteBufAllocator metric in a more general way ([#6485](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/6485))
* Direct buffers in java 9? Reflections on java classes fails on java 9 ([#6269](https://github.com/netty/netty/issues/6269))
* Unpooled buffer acquired from pooled allocator may have .alloc() returning null ([#6436](https://github.com/netty/netty/issues/6436))
* Ensure CombinedChannelDuplexHandler can not be shared. ([#6352](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/6352))

* Buffer alignment ([#6293](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/6293))

The most important changes for 4.1.9.Final only are:

* HTTP/2 SETTINGS ACK sequencing issue ([#6521](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/6521))
