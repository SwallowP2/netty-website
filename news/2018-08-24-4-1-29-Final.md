Today we announce the release of netty 4.1.29.Final. This release contains bugfixes and some improvements.

The most important changes are:

* Correctly handle DNS redirects for NS servers that have no ADDITIONAL records ([#8177](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/8177))
* Ensure multiple shaded version of the same netty artifact can be loaded as long as the shaded prefix is different ([#8207](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/8207))
* Set initial SNI hostname when creating an OpenSSL engine in client mode ([#8178](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/8178))
* DnsNameResolver hangs if search domain results in invalid hostname ([#8180](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/8180))
* Workaround JDK bug that will cause an AssertionError when calling ServerSocketChannel.config().getOptions() ([#8183](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/8183))
* Ensure NIO transport can be used on Java6 again ([#8168](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/8168))
* Lazily initialize NativeDatagramPacketArray and IovArray in EpollEventLoop ([#8160](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/8160))

# Important notes

## DnsNameResolver API breakage

We had to slightly break the DnsNameResolver API to fix ([#8177](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/8177)). Lucky enough changes are very slim you are affect but please read on if you use the resolver.

`DnsNameResolver.authoritativeDnsServerCache()` will now return an instance of `AuthoritativeDnsServerCache` and the previous used `DnsNameResolver.uncachedRedirectDnsServerStream(...)` was replaced by `newRedirectDnsServerStream(...)` (which is protected).

## Memory usage of the native epoll transport

We reduced again the memory usage of the native epoll transport by change some code to init memory lazily. For more details check ([#8160](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/8160)).

## Shading of native transports and netty-tcnative

It should now be possible to shade multiple versions of the native transports of netty and netty-tcnative and use them in the same JVM without any problems. As netty is used in a lot of different projects / libraries this may be useful for you. For any example how you would do shading / use shading check out [testsuite-shading](https://github.com/netty/netty/tree/netty-4.1.29.Final/testsuite-shading) which uses maven but the same steps should apply for other build tools as well.
For more details see ([#7272](https://github.com/netty/netty/issues/7272)), which has all the related PRs linked.
