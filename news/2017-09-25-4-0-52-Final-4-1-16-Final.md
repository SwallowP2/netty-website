## Native library naming

This releases changed the naming scheme of the native .so and .dynlib files that are includes in the native jars to also include the architecture on which these were compiled. This was done as part of ([#7163](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/7163)) to ensure we not load the native transport libs when used on architectures that are not supported. If you use any rules to shade these libs you may need to adjust these to take also the architecture into account.

## Http2ServerDowngrader renamed to Http2StreamFrameToHttpObjectCodec


`Http2ServerDowngrader` was renamed to `Http2StreamFrameToHttpObjectCodec` as it now allows to be used for client and server side. Please do the needed changes if you use this class.
