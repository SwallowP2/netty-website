Here&#39;s another stable release from [the 3.x branch](https://github.com/netty/netty/tree/3).  You can get it from [the downloads page](http://netty.io/downloads.html) and the Maven central repository.  Please report any regressions or bugs via [the issue tracker](https://github.com/netty/netty/issues).

## Notable changes

* You can specify `ThreadNameDeterminer` as a parameter when you construct `Oio*ChannelFactory` and `HashedWheelTimer`. ([#1176](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/1176))
* `ProtobufDecoder` takes advantage of the performance improvements in protobuf 2.5.0. ([#1146](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/1146))
* The message of a `ConnectException` now contains the remote address where the connection attempt was made to. ([#1082](https://github.com/netty/netty/issues/1082))
* NIO transport raises a `ConnectTimeoutException`, which extends `ConnectException`, when a connection attempt timed out. ([#1036](https://github.com/netty/netty/issues/1036))
