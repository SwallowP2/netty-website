# SslHandler behavior change on the server

Prior this release we did not take the handshake timeout into account (which is 10 seconds by default) on the server-side which could have the affect that an ssl handshake would never timeout. With this release this is fixed which has the affect that the handshake is failed if its not completed within 10 seconds by default. If you need a higher timeout please adjust the configuration on the SslHandler instance itself.

# Thank You

Every idea and bug-report counts and so we thought it is worth mentioning those who helped in this area. Please report an unintended omission.
