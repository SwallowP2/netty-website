I'm happy to announce the first release this year a.k.a Netty 4.0.15.Final. This is a bug-fix release, but also ships performance improvements for decoding HTTP responses / requests. Please refer to the next section for more details. The release closes 27 issues / tasks . As expected from a bug-fix release it is API compatible to previous version out of the 4.0.x tree.


## Most important changes / fixes
* NPE in AbstractNioUnsafe.finishConnect() ([#2086](https://github.com/netty/netty/issues/2086)) 
* CancelledKeyException on writeAndFlush(). ([#2104](https://github.com/netty/netty/issues/2104)) 

Visit [here](https://github.com/netty/netty/issues?milestone=82&state=closed) for the complete list of the changes.

As always please let us know if you find any issues. We love feedback!

## Special notes

### Added CORS support
This release also added support for CORS. Please see the ([example](https://github.com/netty/netty/tree/netty-4.0.15.Final/example/src/main/java/io/netty/example/http/cors)) and ([#2070](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/2070)) for more details.

### SPDY server example
A SPDY server example was added to make it even easier for users to get started. Please see the [example code](https://github.com/netty/netty/tree/netty-4.0.15.Final/example/src/main/java/io/netty/example/spdy)) for more details.

## Allow to extend Testsuite 
It is now possible to extend the Testsuite used by netty and so run the tests on a custom transport implementation. This is for advanced use cases only, but still worth to be listed here. 

Every idea and bug-report counts and so we thought it is worth mentioning those who helped in this area. Please report an unintended omission.
