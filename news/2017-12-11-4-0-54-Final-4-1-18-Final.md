title: 'Netty 4.0.54.Final and 4.1.18.Final released'

I'm happy to announce the latest bug-fix releases for our 4.0.x and 4.1.x series after a month of development.
These releases contains bug-fixes, performance enhancements and feature so we encourage everyone to upgrade.

Especially 4.1.18.Final saw various performance improvements compared to the previous version. Most notable here are the improvements when using the `SslHandler` for writing outbound data and quicker ramping up of the amount that will be read from the socket in general when the `AdaptiveRecvByteBufAllocator` is used (this is the default).

The most important changes for 4.0.54.Final and 4.1.18.Final are:

* Ensure we not try to call `select` when the `AbstractSniHandler` was already removed from the pipeline ([#7475](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/7475))
* Not call java methods from within JNI init code to prevent class loading deadlocks ([#7480](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/7480))
* Fixed default OpenSsl cipher suites ([#7450](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/7450))
* Dont use ThreadDeathWatcher to cleanup PoolThreadCache if FastThreadLocalThread with wrapped Runnable is used ([#7445](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/7445))
* Correctly propagate channelInactive even if cleanup throws ([#7415](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/7415))
* Fix writing of empty LastHttpContent with trailers ([#7420](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/7420))
* AbstractByteBuf readSlice bound check bug ([#7416](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/7416))
* Dont fire an SslHandshakeEvent if the handshake was not started at all ([#7368](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/7368))
* Correctly handle 205 Reset Content response with transfer-encoding ([#7397](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/7397))
* CompositeBytebuf.copy() and copy(...) should respect the allocator ([#7395](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/7395))

The most important changes for 4.1.18.Final only are:

* H2C upgrades should be ineligible for flow control ([#7400](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/7400))
* Enforce writeSpinCount to limit resource consumption per socket ([#7478](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/7478))
* Add SniCompletionEvent which allows to easily retrieve the hostname that was used to select the SslContext ([#7444](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/7444))
* SslHandler aggregation prefer copy over CompositeByteBuf ([#7468](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/7468))
* AdaptiveRecvByteBufAllocator should ramp up while reading ([#7466](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/7466))
* Http2ConnectionHandler Http2ConnectionPrefaceAndSettingsFrameWrittenEvent propagation ([#7460](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/7460))
* EDNS Client Subnet is not encoded correctly when source prefix length is not a multiple of 8 ([#7457](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/7457))
* Allow to detect failed query caused by an Timeout / IO error and also not cache these ([#7411](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/7411))
* DefaultHttpHeader.names().toArray(...) may throw ArrayStoreException ([#7429](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/7429))
* HttpConversionUtil TE filtering robustness ([#7422](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/7422))
* Fix DN resolution when ndots is greater than 1 ([#7414](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/7414))
* codec-http2: Improve h1 to h2 header conversion ([#7399](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/7399))
* EpollSocketChannelConfig.getOptions() must not throw if TCP_FASTOPEN_CONNECT is not supported ([#7407](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/7407))
* Don't try to use UnixResolverDnsServerAddressStreamProvider when on Windows ([#7403](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/7403))
* Use Netty's DefaultPriorityQueue instead of JDK's PriorityQueue for scheduled tasks  ([#7384](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/7384))
