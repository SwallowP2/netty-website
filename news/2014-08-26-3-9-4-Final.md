Here's another micro update in 3.9 branch.  The list of the changes is much smaller than that of [3.9.3.Final](/news/2014/08/06/3-9-3-Final.html), mainly because we try to release more often *and* maybe because it's quite mature.

* [#2747](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/2749) - Improve traffic shaping handlers
* [#2767](https://github.com/netty/netty/issues/2767) - Fix a bug in `IpFilterSubnetRule` handling `0.0.0.0/0` incorrectly
* [#2821](https://github.com/netty/netty/issues/2821) - Add a system property to change the default ZLIB compression library in `HttpContentCompressor`

For the detail, please browse [our issue tracker](https://github.com/netty/netty/issues?q=milestone%3A3.9.4.Final).

As always, please let us know if you find any issues.  We love feedback!
