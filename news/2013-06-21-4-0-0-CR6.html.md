title: 'Netty 4.0.0.CR6 released'
author: trustin

We fixed more than a dozen issues in a week since CR5, and some of them were critical - hence a new release.

## Noteworthy changes

* `SslHandler` and `JZlibEncoder` now works correctly. ([#1475] and [#1471])
* Android compatibility issues has been fixed. ([#1451] and [#1472])
* `voidPromise()` works correctly now. ([#1448])
* `SimpleChannelInboundHandler` now releases the handled message by default. You can specify a boolean constructor parameter to revert to the old behavior (manual release).  Note that other handler adapters do not release messages automatically. ([#1446])
* Making a connection attempt in NIO transport causes an `IllegalStateException` ([#1467])
* Various SPDY improvements from the folks at Twitter ([#1456], [#1463], [#1476])
* Less garbage production and efficiency fixes in SCTP transport ([#1457])
