I'm happy to announce the release of Netty 4.0.28.Final,

This release contains 60+ changes, including bug-fixes, improvements and two new exciting features.

If you use Netty with AutoRead disabled we highly recommend upgrading as previous versions of Netty
contained a regression which could lead to stales, when using any decoder that extends either
ByteToMessageDecoder or ReplayingDecoder.

The most important are:

* ChannelFuture is not done after shutdown ([#3567](https://github.com/netty/netty/issues/3662))
* Fix handling of non-auto read for ByteToMessageDecoder and SslHandler ([#3658](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/3658)), ([#3529](https://github.com/netty/netty/issues/3529)), ([#3587](https://github.com/netty/netty/issues/3587))
* Correctly handle EPOLLRDHUP ([#3611](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/3611)), ([#3539](https://github.com/netty/netty/issues/3539))
* Add ChannelPool abstraction and implementations ([#3607](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/3607)), ([#3218](https://github.com/netty/netty/issues/3218))
* Change PoolThreadCache to use LIFO for better cache performance ([#3553](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/3553))
* Add support for ALPN when using openssl + NPN client mode and support for CipherSuiteFilter ([#3481](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/3481)) ([#3481](https://github.com/netty/netty/issues/2845))
* Add support for splice(...) ([#3665](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/3665))
* Allow rejection of remote initiated renegotiation ([#3750](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/3750))
* Not defer close of Channel when in flush ([#3739](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/3739))
* Add support for mutual auth when using OpenSslEngine ([#3732](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/3732))
* Fix possible IllegalStateException caused by closeNotifyTimeout when using SslHandler ([#3727](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/3727))
* Validate cookie name and value characters ([#3748](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/3748))

For the details and all changes, please browse [our issue tracker](https://github.com/netty/netty/issues?q=milestone%3A4.0.28.Final).

## Special notes

### Validate cookie name and value characters

This problem was discovered by the [LinkedIn Security Team](https://www.linkedin.com) and could lead to security
problems due the improper parsing of Cookies (without strict validating).

### ChannelPool

Many of our users needed to support connection pooling at some point when they used Netty to writing a client. This resulted in a lot of duplicated code. With the release of 4.0.28.Final
we include a pool API that users can use to implement there own ChannelPool or reuse either the SimpleChannelPool or the FixedChannelPool that are provided by Netty itself.

    EventLoopGroup group = new NioEventLoopGroup();
    final Bootstrap cb = new Bootstrap();
    InetSocketAddress addr1 = new InetSocketAddress("10.0.0.10", 8888);
    InetSocketAddress addr2 = new InetSocketAddress("10.0.0.11", 8888);

    cb.group(group).channel(NioSocketChannel.class);

    ChannelPoolMap<InetSocketAddress, SimpleChannelPool> poolMap = new AbstractChannelPoolMap<InetSocketAddress, SimpleChannelPool>() {
        @Override
        protected SimpleChannelPool newPool(InetSocketAddress key) {
            return new SimpleChannelPool(cb.remoteAddress(key), new TestChannelPoolHandler());
        }
    };

    // depending on when you use addr1 or addr2 you will get different pools.
    final SimpleChannelPool pool = poolMap.get(addr1);
    Future<Channel> f = pool.acquire();
    f.addListener(new FutureListener<Channel>() {
        @Override
        public void operationComplete(Future<Channel> f) {
            if (f.isSuccess()) {
                Channel ch = f.getNow();
                // Do somethings
                // ...
                // ...

                // Release back to pool
                pool.release(ch);
            }
        }
    });

The important thing to note is that your `key` could be everything. This makes it very flexible... For example you could have different pools for different EventLoops etc.

Please refer to the api documentation in the `io.netty.transport.pool` package.

### Splice


This release includes support for [splice](http://linux.die.net/man/2/splice) when using the native epoll transport. Splicing allows to directly transfer bytes from one filedescriptor
to another without copy data from kernel to user-space. This makes splice a perfect fit i.e when you want to write a TCP proxy.

The following code snipped shows a full TCP proxy that uses splicing:


    EventLoopGroup group = new EpollEventLoopGroup(1);
    ServerBootstrap bs2 = new ServerBootstrap();
    bs2.channel(EpollServerSocketChannel.class);
    bs2.childOption(EpollChannelOption.EPOLL_MODE, EpollMode.LEVEL_TRIGGERED);
    bs2.group(group).childHandler(new ChannelInboundHandlerAdapter() {
        @Override
        public void channelActive(final ChannelHandlerContext ctx) throws Exception {
            ctx.channel().config().setAutoRead(false);
            Bootstrap bs = new Bootstrap();
            bs.option(EpollChannelOption.EPOLL_MODE, EpollMode.LEVEL_TRIGGERED);

            bs.channel(EpollSocketChannel.class);
            bs.group(ctx.channel().eventLoop()).handler(new ChannelInboundHandlerAdapter() {
                @Override
                public void channelActive(ChannelHandlerContext context) throws Exception {
                    final EpollSocketChannel ch = (EpollSocketChannel) ctx.channel();
                    final EpollSocketChannel ch2 = (EpollSocketChannel) context.channel();
                    // We are splicing two channels together, at this point we have a tcp proxy which handles all
                    // the data transfer only in kernel space!

                    // Integer.MAX_VALUE will splice infinitly.
                    ch.spliceTo(ch2, Integer.MAX_VALUE).addListener(new ChannelFutureListener() {
                        @Override
                        public void operationComplete(ChannelFuture future) throws Exception {
                            if (!future.isSuccess()) {
                                future.channel().close();
                            }
                        }
                    });
                    // Trigger multiple splices to see if partial splicing works as well.
                    ch2.spliceTo(ch, SPLICE_LEN).addListener(new ChannelFutureListener() {
                        @Override
                        public void operationComplete(ChannelFuture future) throws Exception {
                            if (!future.isSuccess()) {
                                future.channel().close();
                            } else {
                                ch2.spliceTo(ch, SPLICE_LEN).addListener(this);
                            }
                        }
                    });
                    ctx.channel().config().setAutoRead(true);
                }

                @Override
                public void channelInactive(ChannelHandlerContext context) throws Exception {
                    context.close();
                }
            });
            bs.connect(new InetSocketAddress("10.0.0.10", 8888)).addListener(new ChannelFutureListener() {
                @Override
                public void operationComplete(ChannelFuture future) throws Exception {
                    if (!future.isSuccess()) {
                        ctx.close();
                    } else {
                        future.channel().closeFuture().addListener(new ChannelFutureListener() {
                            @Override
                            public void operationComplete(ChannelFuture future) throws Exception {
                                ctx.close();
                            }
                        });
                    }
                }
            });
        }
    });
    Channel pc = bs2.bind(new InetSocketAddress(0)).syncUninterruptibly().channel();


Beside this we also support splicing directly to a file. For more informations please refer to the `AbstractEpollStreamChannel` javadocs.


As always, please let us know if you find any issues. We love feedback!
