Unfortunately we introduces a regression in the previous released 3.6.4.Final, so we decided to release 3.6.5.Final as soon as possible. The regression could lead to CPU-Spinning even while idling. Everyone is adviced to upgrade from 3.6.4.Final to 3.6.5.Final as soon as possible. This release is cut from [the 3.x branch](https://github.com/netty/netty/tree/3) and is a bug-fix only release, which only fix the mention regression.  You can get it from [the downloads page](http://netty.io/downloads.html) and the Maven central repository.  Please report any regressions or bugs via [the issue tracker](https://github.com/netty/netty/issues).
