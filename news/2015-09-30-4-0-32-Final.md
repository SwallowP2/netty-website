# Special Notes

With this release two new `EpollChannelOption`s are introduced that can be used if you use the native epoll transport that is shipped as part of Netty.

`EpollChannelOption.TCP_FASTOPEN` => TCP Fast Open allows data to be carried in the SYN and SYN-ACK packets and consumed by the receiving end during the initial connection handshake, and saves up to one full round-trip time (RTT) compared to the standard TCP, which requires a three-way handshake (3WHS) to complete before data can be exchanged.

`EpollChannelOption.TCP_MD5SIG` => enables TCP MD5 authentication to protect sessions from being hijacked/torn down by
third parties.
