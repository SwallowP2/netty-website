Today we released Netty 4.0.9.Final. This is a bug-fix release. As expected from a bug-fix release it is API compatible to previous version out of the 4.0.x tree.

In summary this release closes 13 issues.

* internalNioBuffer(...) lead to races when using from derived ByteBuf implementations ([#1801](https://github.com/netty/netty/issues/1801)) 
* LengthFieldBasedFrameDecoder produces IllegalArgumentException when frame is too big ([#1798](https://github.com/netty/netty/issues/1798))
