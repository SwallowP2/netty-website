This is the forth bug-fix release out of the new stable 4.x tree. This release includes critical bug-fixes for resource leaks. Thus we advice to upgrade as soon as possible.

Beside this, this release includes many other bug-fixes and improvements. In summary we closed 27 issues.

This release would have been not possible without the feedback of our community. We welcome everyone to [become a part of it](http://netty.io/community.html), and help us to make Netty even better!

## Important changes
As noted above this release contains critical fixes as listed bellow:

* java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: Direct buffer memory. ([#1574](https://github.com/netty/netty/issues/1574))
* Stackoverflow using ImmediateEventExecutor. ([#1602](https://github.com/netty/netty/issues/1602))
* ChannelOutboundBuffer#addMessage may produce writes out of order ([#1619](https://github.com/netty/netty/issues/1619))
