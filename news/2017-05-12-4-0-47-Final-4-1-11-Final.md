I'm happy to announce the latest bug-fix releases for our 4.0.x and 4.1.x series.
These releases contains bug-fixes, performance enhancements and feature so we encourage everyone to upgrade.

The most important changes for 4.0.47.Final and 4.1.11.Final are:

* OpenSslEngine wrap may generate bad data if multiple src buffers ([#6715](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/6715))
* Ensure Netty is usable on Java7 ([#6703](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/6703))
* Not try to compresses HttpMessage if IDENTITY header value is set ([#6690](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/#6690))
* ByteToMessageDecoder#handlerRemoved may release cumulation buffer prematurely ([#6728](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/#6728))
* ByteBuf#ensureWritable(int, boolean) should not throw
([#6721](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/#6721))

The most important change for 4.1.11.Final is:

* New native transport for kqueue ([#6000](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/6000))

For the details and all changes, please browse our issue tracker for [4.0.47.Final](https://github.com/netty/netty/milestone/162?closed=1) and [4.1.11.Final](https://github.com/netty/netty/milestone/163?closed=1).

All changes that are in 4.0.47.Final are also included in 4.1.11.Final. All changes only have milestone 4.1.11.Final do not affect 4.0.47.Final.

As always, please let us know if you find any issues. We love feedback!

# KQueue transport

The new 4.1.11.Final release contains a native transport for kqueue which you may want to check out. This transport also supports Unix Domain Sockets, just as the native epoll transport does.

For more details please check the apidocs and our [tests](https://github.com/netty/netty/tree/netty-4.1.11.Final/transport-native-kqueue/src/test/java/io/netty/channel/kqueue).

# Important note

This release also fixes a [regression](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/6715) when using `SslProvider.OPENSSL` and `SslProvider.OPENSSL_REFCNT` that was introduced in 4.0.46.Final / 4.1.10.Final so we strongly encourage you to upgrade if you are using one of these releases and want to make use of the native SSLEngine implementation.
