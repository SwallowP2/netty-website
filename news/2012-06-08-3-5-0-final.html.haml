  </ul>
  <p><strong>Gathering writes</strong></p>
  <p>A user can force gathering writes (on jdk &gt;= 7) by using one of the new methods in <tt>ChannelBuffers</tt> that take an extra argument to enable gathering writes.</p>
  <ul>
  <li><tt>ChannelBuffers.wrappedBuffer(boolean gathering, ChannelBuffer... buffers)</tt></li>
  <li><tt>ChannelBuffer.wrappedBuffer(boolean gathering, ByteBuffer... buffers)</tt></li>
  </ul>
  <p>Default is no gathering writes..</p>
  <p><strong>API Breakage in SPDY</strong></p>
  <p>Please note that this release includes some "small" API Breakage in the spdy package, which should not effect most of you. All static field values that were located in the <tt>SpdyHeaders.HttpNames</tt> class were moved to the <tt>Spdy2Headers.HttpNames</tt> class. The ones that are now in <tt>SpdyHeaders.HttpNames</tt> are related to SPDY3. The ones in <tt>Spdy2Headers</tt> are the old ones that are related to SPDY2.</p>
  <p>Along with the new features mentioned above, this release also includes many other bugfixes.</p>
  <p>For the detailed list of the changes, please refer to <span class="wikiexternallink"><a href="https://github.com/netty/netty/issues?milestone=16&amp;page=1&amp;state=closed">the issue tracker page</a></span>.</p>
