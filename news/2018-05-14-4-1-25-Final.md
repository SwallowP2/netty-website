I'm happy to announce the latest release of the 4.1 series.

These releases contains bug-fixes, performance enhancements and feature so we encourage everyone to upgrade.
Importantly it also fixes a [regression](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/7878) of 4.1.23.Final which could lead to have resources not cleaned up correctly in some cases.

The most important changes are:

* Fix eternal loop in Recycler.WeakOrderQueue.Head#run() that blocks ObjectCleaner thread  ([#7878](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/7878))
* Filter DNS results so they only contain the expected type when multiple types are present ([#7875](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/7875))
* Only reset readIsPending if outboundBuffer is not empty ([#7874](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/7874))
* AsciiString#indexOf out of bounds ([#7866](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/7866))


For the details and all changes, please browse our issue tracker for  [4.1.24.Final](https://github.com/netty/netty/issues?q=is%3Aclosed+milestone%3A4.1.24.Final).
