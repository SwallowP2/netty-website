# Special Notes

With this release two new `EpollChannelOption`s are introduced that can be used if you use the native epoll transport that is shipped as part of Netty.

`EpollChannelOption.TCP_USER_TIMEOUT` => allows to set the TCP_USER_TIMEOUT on a socket. See man 7 tcp for more details on what exactly this setting is useful for.

`EpollChannelOption.IP_FREEBIND` => allows to bind to addresses without the address up yet or even the interface configured yet.

# Thank You
