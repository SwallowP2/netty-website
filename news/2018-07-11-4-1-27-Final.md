title: 'Netty 4.1.27.Final released'

Due some possible regression that could cause an NPE during selecting the keymaterial if the alias is not known when using OpenSSL (and so signal back the wrong alert to the remote peer)  we decided to cut another netty releases. While it was possible to "work around" this regression by using a `KeyManagerFactory` to configure `SslContextBuilder` we thought this deserves a fast release.

Beside fixing the above mentioned bug we also fixes a few other small things.

For the details and all changes, please browse our issue tracker for  [4.1.27.Final](https://github.com/netty/netty/issues?q=is%3Aclosed+milestone%3A4.1.27.Final).
