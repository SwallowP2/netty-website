I'm happy to announce the first bug-fix release for our 4.1.x series today.

This release contains many bug-fixes and also one security bug-fix which was filled as [CVE-2016-4970](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-4970) and can lead to
a DOS. Because of this security bugfix you should upgrade ASAP if you use our `OpenSslEngine`
which is true if you have `netty-tcnative` on your classpath and openssl libraries installed on the system.


The most important changes are:

* OpenSslEngine writePlaintextData WANT_READ with no data in BIO buffer ([#5364](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/5364))
* Ensure the correct wrapped buffer is released in AbstractPooledDerivedByteBuf.deallocate() ([#5347](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/5347))

For the details and all changes, please browse [our issue tracker](https://github.com/netty/netty/issues?q=milestone%3A4.1.1.Final+is%3Aclosed).

As always, please let us know if you find any issues. We love feedback!
