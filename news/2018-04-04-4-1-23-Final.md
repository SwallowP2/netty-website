I'm happy to announce the latest release of the 4.1 series.

These releases contains bug-fixes, performance enhancements and feature so we encourage everyone to upgrade.

The most important changes are:

* SctpMessageCompletionHandler may leak ByteBuf for fragmented messages ([#7832](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/7832))
* Don't replace all connection headers when sending h2c upgrade request ([#7824](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/7824))
* ChunkedWriteHandler: avoid writing two times the same message ([#7822](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/7822))
* Limit the number of bytes to use to copy the content of a direct buffer to OutputStream ([#7813](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/7813))
* NIO read spin event loop spin when half closed ([#7801](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/7801))
* HttpServerUpgradeHandler shouldn't wait for flush to reshape pipeline ([#7807](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/7807))
* Support Redis inline commands ([#7687](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/7687))
* Ensure we not schedule multiple timeouts for close notify ([#7799](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/7799))
* HttpProxyHandler generates invalid CONNECT url and Host header when address is resolved ([#7784](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/7784))
* Correctly handle non IOException during read in NioServerSocketChannel ([#7806](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/7806))
* Correctly record creation stacktrace in ResourceLeakDetector. ([#7782](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/7782))
* PendingWriteQueue to handle write operations with void future ([#7780](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/7780))
* IovArray.add(...) should check if buffer has memory address ([#7774](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/7774))
* FixedCompositeByteBuf should allow to access memoryAddress / array when wrap a single buffer ([#7773](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/7773))
* Close SSLEngine when connection fails. ([#7746](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/7746))
* Workaround SSLEngine.unwrap(...) bug in Android 5.0 ([#7761](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/7761))
* Flush task should not flush messages that were written since last flush attempt ([#7743](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/7743))
* Copies from read-only heap ByteBuffer to direct ByteBuf can avoid stealth ByteBuf allocation and additional copies ([#7739](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/7739))
