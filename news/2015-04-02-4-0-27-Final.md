I'm happy to announce the release of Netty 4.0.27.Final,

This release contains 20+ changes, including bug-fixes, improvements and tasks.

The most important are:

* Excessively large cumulation ByteBuf in SslHandler ([#3567](https://github.com/netty/netty/issues/3567))
* Cannot subclass HttpHeaders and build with JDK 7 with maven build of 4.0.26.Final ([#3548](https://github.com/netty/netty/issues/3548))
* Add supported for X509ExtendedTrustManager when using OpenSslEngine ([#3494](https://github.com/netty/netty/pulls/3494))
* Respect -Djava.net.preferIPv4Stack when using epoll transport ([#3478](https://github.com/netty/netty/pulls/3478))
* EpollSocketChannel.localAddress() returns always null if Native.connect() was not able to connect directly ([#3463](https://github.com/netty/netty/pulls/3463))

For the details and all changes, please browse [our issue tracker](https://github.com/netty/netty/issues?q=milestone%3A4.0.27.Final).
