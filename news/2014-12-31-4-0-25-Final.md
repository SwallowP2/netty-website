I'm happy to announce Netty 4.0.25.Final before 2014 ends! It would be awesome if anyone finds this release a great happy new year present.

It took us two months since the previous release in 4.0 branch, and we must admit we have a lot to improve here. We know you are also waiting for 4.1 & 5.0 releases with all the shiny new features. Please stay tuned! I expect myself to deliver them before January ends.

Putting a new year's resolution aside, this release, as well as 20+ bug fixes, contains the following exciting new features and improvements:

* SSL
   * `SslContext` adds ALPN and mutual authentication support.
   * `SslHandler.renegotiate()` adds proper SSL renegotiation support.
   * `SniHandler` adds Server Name Indication support.
   * `OpenSslEngine` is now (almost) feature-complete with client mode support.
      * Works as a drop-in replacement of JDK stock `SSLEngineImpl`!
* SPDY
   * Pushed resource support
* HTTP
   * Higher performance
* Linux native transport (epoll)
   * Higher performance

For the detail, please browse [our issue tracker](https://github.com/netty/netty/issues?q=milestone%3A4.0.25.Final).

As always, please let us know if you find any issues. We love feedback!
