I'm happy to announce the release of Netty 4.0.30.Final.

This release contains 30+ changes, including bug-fixes, improvements and new features.
If you use the OpenSslEngine we highly recommend upgrading as this release brings performance enhancements in this area.

The most important changes are:

* ServerBootstrap.handler(...) will add handler before Channel is registered ([#3933](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/3933))
* Ensure OpenSslSession informations can be retrieved even after shutdown ([#3934](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/3934))
* NullPointerException in PendingWriteQueue ([#3967](https://github.com/netty/netty/issues/3967)) ([#3991](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/3991)
* Disable RC4 by default when using SslContext ([#3987](https://github.com/netty/netty/issues/3987)) ([#4014](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/4014))
* FixedChannelPool does not count acquired channels precisely ([#3988](https://github.com/netty/netty/issues/3988)) ([#4016](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/4016))
* Correctly register for EPOLLRDHUP when construct EpollSocketChannel for file descriptor ([#4013](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/4013))
* Ensure cancelled scheduled tasks can be GC'ed ASAP ([#3994](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/3994))
* Send full response for unsupported websocket versions ([#3999](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/3999))
* Stop calling BIO_write once internal buffer is full ([#3957](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/3957))
* Only do priming read if there is no space in dsts buffers  ([#3958](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/3958))
* Better handling of BUFFER_OVERFLOW when unwrap data ([#3959](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/3959))
