# Important notes

## Renegotiation support removed

This release remove renegotiation support when using OpenSSL / LibreSSL / BoringSSL as we consider it as insecure and so a security risk. If you depend on this feature (you should not!) you will need to use `SslProvider.JDK`.

## 4.0.x releases

We will only do one more release (after this) for the 4.0 tree. After that we will move development to 4.1.x and 5.x (next-major) only.

As always, please let us know if you find any issues. We love feedback!
