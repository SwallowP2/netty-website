I'm happy to announce the release of Netty 4.1.0.Beta7 after fixing a lot of issues since the last beta release.

This release contains a lot of fixes but also API improvements in the HTTP/2 codec.

The most important changes are:

* DefaultHttp2RemoteFlowController may not write all pending bytes  ([#4258](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/4258)) ([#4242](https://github.com/netty/netty/issues/4242))
* Ensure close caused by write will happen before write promise is notified ([#4225](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/4225))
* SpdyHttpEncoder fails to convert HttpResponse to SpdyFrame ([#4190](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/4190)) ([#4185](https://github.com/netty/netty/issues/4185))
* StompHeaders constants can no longer be used to fetch headers from DefaultHeaders ([#4247](https://github.com/netty/netty/issues/4247))
* DefaultHttp2RemoteFlowController not allocating all available bytes ([#4282](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/4282)) ([#4266](https://github.com/netty/netty/issues/4266))
