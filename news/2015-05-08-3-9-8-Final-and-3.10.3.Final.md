I'm happy to announce the release of Netty 3.9.8.Final and 3.10.3.Final.

These releases contain a possible security fix and a few minor changes.

* Validate cookie name and value characters ([#3754](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/3754))

As always, please let us know if you find any issues. We love feedback!

## Special notes

### Validate cookie name and value characters

This problem was discovered by the [LinkedIn Security Team](https://www.linkedin.com) and could lead to security
problems due the improper parsing of Cookies (without strict validating).

# Thank You

Every idea and bug-report counts and so we thought it is worth mentioning those who helped in this area. Please report an unintended omission.

A special thank you to the [LinkedIn Security Team](https://www.linkedin.com) for reporting the possible security bug.
