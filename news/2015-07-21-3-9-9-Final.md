I'm happy to announce the release of Netty 3.9.9.Final.

These releases contains two bug-fixes.

* Fix cookie encoding when maxAge is greater than 24 days ([#4008](https://github.com/netty/netty/issues/4008))
* Fix invalid check arguments in 'OpenSslServerContext.setTicketKeys' ([#4009](https://github.com/netty/netty/issues/4009))

As always, please let us know if you find any issues. We love feedback!

# Thank You

Every idea and bug-report counts and so we thought it is worth mentioning those who helped in this area. Please report an unintended omission.
