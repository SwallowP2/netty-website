I'm happy to announce the release of Netty 4.1.0.CR3.

For the details and all changes, please browse [our issue tracker](https://github.com/netty/netty/issues?q=milestone%3A4.1.0.CR3+is%3Aclosed).

As always, please let us know if you find any issues. We love feedback!

# Important notes
As our http2 and dns codecs are still quite new we "mark" these as experimental which means we may break the api's of these in later releases.

# Thank You

Every idea and bug-report counts and so we thought it is worth mentioning those who helped in this area. Please report an unintended omission.
