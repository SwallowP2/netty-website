  <p>Hello Netty community,</p>
  <p>I have successfully finished the migration of our web site from the <span class="wikiexternallink"><a href="http://jboss.org/">JBoss.org</a></span> to our own domain, <span class="wikiexternallink"><a href="http://netty.io/">netty.io</a></span>. The new web site and its complete source code is hosted at <span class="wikiexternallink"><a href="https://github.com/netty/netty-website/">Github</a></span>.</p>
  <p>In this announcement, I'd like to mention what this means for us:</p>
  <ul>
  <li>We are no longer a member of the JBoss Community.</li>
  <li>The user forum is replaced with <span class="wikiexternallink"><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/netty">StackOverflow</a></span>. Please don't forget to tag your questions with 'netty'.</li>
  <li>The developer forum is replaced with a <span class="wikiexternallink"><a href="https://groups.google.com/d/forum/netty">Google Group</a></span>. Invitations will be sent to the subscribers.</li>
  <li>JIRA is replaced with <span class="wikiexternallink"><a href="https://github.com/netty/netty/issues">the Github issue tracker</a></span>.</li>
  <li>Wiki is replaced with <span class="wikiexternallink"><a href="https://github.com/netty/netty/wiki">the Github wiki</a></span>.</li>
  <li>The announcement forum is replaced with the news section of the web site. We will post interesting news and articles there. <span class="wikiexternallink"><a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/netty_project">(RSS Feed)</a></span>
  </li>
  </ul>
  <p>The old web site at http:/jboss.org/netty will contain announcements to redirect you to the new web site. All forums, JIRA project, and wiki pages will go read-only, too.</p>
  <p>With this big move, I believe, both the users and developers will take advantage of the best-of-the-breed services. Contributing to the web site content and documentation will also become much easier because everything is now hosted at Git repositories. Just fork it and send a pull request.</p>
  <p>I'd like to thank <span class="wikiexternallink"><a href="http://twitter.com/jobs">Twitter</a></span> for allowing me to take the exciting opportunity to join the flock and to spend more time on the project and make this move happen.</p>
  <p>What do you think about the new web site? Does it look good? What do you miss from the old web site? What would make it even better? Let us know!</p>
