Today we announce the release of netty 4.1.28.Final. This release contains bugfixes and add support to use any supported SocketOption by the JDK. Please upgrade once you have the chance.

The most important changes are:

* Support the usage of SocketOption when nio is used and the java version >= 7 ([#8085](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/8085))
* Leak detection combined with composite buffers results in incorrectly handled writerIndex when calling ByteBufUtil.writeAscii/writeUtf8 ([#8153](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/8153))
* Allow to validate sni hostname with underscore ([#8150](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/8150))
* HTTP/2 child channel read cycle doesn't respect RecvByteBufAllocator and may drop data if stream closed while auto read is off ([#8147](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/8147))


For the details and all changes, please browse our issue tracker for  [4.1.28.Final](https://github.com/netty/netty/issues?q=is%3Aclosed+milestone%3A4.1.28.Final).
