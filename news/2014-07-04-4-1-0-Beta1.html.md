Have you been looking forward to all the new features of Netty 5.0 and worried about its release schedule and migration cost due to backward-incompatibility?

Not anymore!  We have backported most new features of 5.0 and just released 4.1.0.Beta1.  There are so many interesting features, but to list a few of them:

* We support Android 4.0+ officially.
* Channel ID is back, with global uniqueness.
* You can customize Netty's thread model.
* New or improved codecs
  * Binary memcache protocol codec (by [@daschl](https://github.com/daschl))
  * DNS protocol codec (by [@mbakkar](https://github.com/mbakkar) and [@normanmaurer](https://github.com/normanmaurer))
  * HAProxy protocol codec (by [@jkeys089](https://github.com/jkeys089))
  * MQTT protocol codec (by [@mousom](https://github.com/mousom))
  * STOMP codec (by [@sskachkov](https://github.com/sskachkov))
  * You can also stream XML documents and JSON objects using `XmlFrameDecoder` (by [@mcaserta](https://github.com/mcaserta)) and `JsonObjectDecoder` (by [@jakobbuchgraber](https://github.com/jakobbuchgraber).)
  * You have more control when `HttpObjectAggregator` receives an oversized message.

Visit [our wiki page](http://netty.io/wiki/new-and-noteworthy-in-4.1.html) for more detailed list of the changes.  You can also browse [our issue tracker](https://github.com/netty/netty/issues?q=milestone%3A4.1.0.Beta1) for the gory detail.

As always please let us know if you find any issues. We love feedback!
