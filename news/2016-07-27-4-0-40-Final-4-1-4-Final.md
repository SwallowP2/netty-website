I'm happy to announce the latest bug-fix releases for our 4.0.x and 4.1.x series today.

The releases contain bug-fixes, performance enhancements and new features.


__Important:__ These releases also fix a possible crash when using netty-tcnative-boringssl-static (see ([#5733](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/5733)) so please upgrade ASAP if you this.

The most important changes for 4.0.41.Final and 4.1.5.Final are:

* Result of ByteBufUtil.compare(ByteBuf a, ByteBuf b) is dependent on ByteOrder of supplied ByteBufs ([#5732](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/5732))
* Ensure fireChannelActive() is also called if Channel is closed in connect promise ([#5724](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/5724))
* Ensure SslHandler.close(...) will not throw exception if flush of pending messages fail ([#5685](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/5685))
* Static initializers can cause deadlock ([#5730](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/5730))
* Detect if netty-tcnative is in classpath or just tcnative ([#5666](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/5666))
* Ensure direct ByteBuffer are wrapped in as direct ByteBuf ([#5629](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/5629))
* Allow to limit the maximum number of WeakOrderQueue instances per Thread ([#5592](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/5592))
* Ensure correct ordering if a ChannelInitializer adds another ChannelInitializer ([#5588](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/5588))
* Servers should not send duplicate intermediate certificates ([#5606](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/5606))
* Not try to double release empty buffer in Unpooled.wrappedBuffer ([#5605](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/5605))
* Ensure SslHandler not log false-positives when try to close the Channel due timeout ([#5604](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/5604))
* Introduce allocation / pooling ratio in Recycler ([#5594](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/5594))

The most important changes for 4.1.5.Final only are:

* Ensure we not log missleading errors if the promise was already failed due errors ([#5689](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/5689))
* HTTP/2 limit streams in all states ([#5671](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/5671))
* Disable IPv6 address lookups when -Djava.net.preferIPv4Stack=false ([#5659](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/5659))
* Add NonStickyEventExecutorGroup ([#5579](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/5579))
* Fix RejectedExecutionException when using DnsAddressResolverGroup ([#5612](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/5612))
