We found a critical regression which might affect some applications that use a `FileRegion`, and had to cut the hot fix releases; Netty 4.0.23.Final and 4.1.0.Beta3

* [#2407](https://github.com/netty/netty/issues/2407) - Use a better default value for server socket backlog
* [#2768](https://github.com/netty/netty/issues/2768) - Fix an empty WebSocket close frame in hybi-00
* [#2769](https://github.com/netty/netty/issues/2769) - Fix `ClassCastException` when trying to send a `FileRegion`
* [#2771](https://github.com/netty/netty/issues/2771) - Fix a bug where `EmbeddedChannel` does not work with `ChannelInitializer`

You can also browse [our issue tracker](https://github.com/netty/netty/issues?q=milestone%3A4.0.23.Final) for the gory detail.

As always, please let us know if you find something to fix, improve, discuss, or even criticize.  We love your feedback!
