We decided to release another release candidate before going final due to an interoperability issue with our DNS codec. It's only a few days since we released Netty 4.1.0.CR5, so this release contains relatively small number of changes.

The notable changes in this release are:

* Customizable NIO and epoll select strategy ([#4955](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/4955) and [#5044](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/5044))
* Deprecate `WRITE_BUFFER_LOW/HIGH_WATER_MARK` in favor of `WRITE_BUFFER_WATER_MARK` ([#5060](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/5060) and [#4858](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/4858))
* Change the visibility of DefaultChannelId to public ([#5057](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/5057))
* Fix propagation of `channelRegistered()` event in `ChannelInitializer` ([#4995](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/4995))
* Fix incorrect name encoding/decoding in DNS records ([#5064](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/5064))
* Fix missing `@Sharable` annotation in `MqttEncoder` ([#5063](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/5063))
* Fix the bug where epoll ET with `autoRead` set to `false` will leaves data on the RECV queue ([#5061](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/5061))

For the details and all changes, please browse [our issue tracker](https://github.com/netty/netty/issues?q=milestone%3A4.1.0.CR6+is%3Aclosed).

As always, please let us know if you find any issues. We love feedback!

# A note about API backward compatibility

As our HTTP/2 and DNS codecs are still quite new. We "mark" them as experimental which means we may break the API backward compatibility of them in later releases.

# Thank You

Every idea and bug-report counts and so we thought it is worth mentioning those who helped in this area. Please report an unintended omission.
