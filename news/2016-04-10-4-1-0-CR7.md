We decided to release another release candidate before going final due some more last minute fixes. It's only a week  since we released Netty 4.1.0.CR6, so this release contains relatively small number of changes.

The notable changes in this release are:

* EPOLL ET Set ReadFlag and Limit epollInReadyRunnable ([#5103](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/5103))
* NIO autoReadClear should also clear the SelectionKey ([#5101](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/5101))
* Propagate UPGRADE_SUCCESSFUL event before removing source codec ([#5096](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/5096))
* NIO/EPOLL readPending set to false incorrectly ([#5067](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/5067))
* Add smtp codec (client side only) ([#4194](https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/4194))

For the details and all changes, please browse [our issue tracker](https://github.com/netty/netty/issues?q=milestone%3A4.1.0.CR7+is%3Aclosed).

As always, please let us know if you find any issues. We love feedback!

## A note about API backward compatibility

As our HTTP/2 and DNS codecs are still quite new. We "mark" them as experimental which means we may break the API backward compatibility of them in later releases.

# Thank You

Every idea and bug-report counts and so we thought it is worth mentioning those who helped in this area. Please report an unintended omission.
